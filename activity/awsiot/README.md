## Configuration

### Certificate Installation
The activity looks for the Aws device certificates in a "things" directory relative to where the engine was started.  Download the [root CA certificate](https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/verisign/roots/VeriSign-Class%203-Public-Primary-Certification-Authority-G5.pem) file and save it as "things/root-CA.pem.crt". Now place the cert and private key generated by Aws IoT for your thing under "things/[thingName]" as device.pem.crt and device.pem.key respectively.  
### Flow Configuration
Configure a task in flow to update the device shadow of 'raspberry-pi' with a reported temp of "50".
